# STAT-452-Project

***

Given training data with a response Y and 40 explanatory variables (X1, X2, ... , X40), we must fit a model to best predict Y.

The file 452Project.qmd contains all my R code for this given project.

The STAT452_Project.pdf is a report which showcases my thought process while fitting different models and my final analysis.
